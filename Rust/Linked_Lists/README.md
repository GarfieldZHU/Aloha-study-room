# Too Many Linked Lists

The [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/)

## Keynotes

---
- Recursive structures must be boxed. // Refers to [std::boxed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html)
- The internals of `enum` are exposed public, so no private member is expected in a `pub enum`
